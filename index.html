<h1>Hey,</h1>
<h2>Complete the following steps in order to run my application.</h2> <br> 
<h2>You'll need a computer to run this application (no mobile version, unfortunately).</h2>
    
<h3>Step 1.</h3>
Click <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OD5v0prYFHwZFYH9iLwKP1H7Y36LzUYL" target="_blank">here</a> to view a zip of the application that I've uploaded to Google Drive. 
    
<h3>Step 2.</h3>
Click the "Download" icon in the top, right-hand corner of the window, as shown below. <br> <br>

<h3>Step 3.</h3>
You should receive the following message: <br> <br>

Click the button marked "Download Anyway". 
    
<h3>Step 4.</h3>
Once the download is complete, you'll need to go to the "Downloads" folder in Finder (for Mac) / File Explorer (for Windows) and extract the contents of the .zip file. <br> Note: Extraction may sometimes be completed automatically. 
    
<h3>Step 5.</h3>
Go the destination folder of the extraction and open the application file entitled "Weird_Line_Generator". In the screen shot below, you can see the extracted application file (top item) and the unextracted .zip file (second item). <br> File names may differ a little (I've now uploaded version two).<br><br>

If you run into issues here, you may need to do the following: <br> 

    - For Mac users: right-click on the application file entitled "Weird_Line_Generator" and hit "Open". Then follow the prompt to open the application <br> 
    - For Windows users: to run the application, follow the path <i>Weird_Line_Generator 2.0.app > Contents > Java > JavaFXApp </i><br> <br>  
    
<h3>Note:</h3>
If you do not already have Java installed on your computer, you may run into some issues throughout this process. Java, version 8, can be downloaded <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/">here</a>. Just follow the prompts to install. <br> <br>
